# Evidence and source policy

## What validators receive

Validators judge only on-chain requirements and quote text. No contractor history, licensing database, market price, or external source is collected.

All submitted text is treated as untrusted evidence, never as instructions. Evidence fields and aggregate storage are bounded before they reach the prompt. The decision schema is fixed and independently replayed by validators.

## Who selects the evidence

The authorized roles in the state machine—customer and at least two bidders—supply the evidence. Their signatures establish which on-chain role submitted a record; they do not prove that the record is truthful or complete.

## External collection

This version performs no live web browsing, URL fetching, hidden source lookup, or mutable off-chain collection. That makes the deployed judgment reproducible from contract state, while leaving source authenticity as an explicit application-layer responsibility.

## Trust and production boundary

Coverage is not legal advice, vendor due diligence, or a binding procurement decision. Identity, licensing, references, and contract execution stay off-chain. If an adapter later fetches external material, its allowlist, content bounds, snapshot rules, publisher trust, correction policy, and failure behavior require a new review.
